# snake-console
A simple snake console game: my first project in C++

Download the executable from releases: https://github.com/Tortle6/snake-console/releases.

To play, use the WASD keys.
There will be some flickering. There is no way to prevent this, since writing to the console takes time. This was minimized in 0.1.1 and 0.3.1.

WARNING: This only works on Windows.
